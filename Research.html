<p>My research interests are divided into two realms: applications of mathematics in science, and mathematical education. In the fields of applied mathematics, I am interested in applying mathematical methods to analyze systems that arise in biochemistry, biophysics, and electrochemistry.  My main goal is to use both old and new areas of physics, chemistry, and biology to test existing theory and develop new methods for mathematical modelling and computer simulation of natural phenomena. Whenever possible, I seek analytical solutions of developed models in order to reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for controlling the system.  These analytical solutions are then used as a guiding tool to validate complex regimes where the assumptions of the idealized model break down. </p>

<p>In the field of mathematical education, I am interested in student math attitude and the effects of math anxiety on student success.  My main goal is to use numerical mathematical tools to analyze pre-existing student responses to assignment and/or test problems to identify areas of weakness and contributing factors to increased math anxiety.  This numerical analysis can then be leveraged to develop interventions and support mechanisms to aid students in their mathematical understanding, attitude towards mathematics, and their success in the classroom. </p>
